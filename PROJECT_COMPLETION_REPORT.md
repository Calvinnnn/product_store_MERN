## 🔗 API Integration Summary

All 4 backend APIs are fully integrated:

| Method | Endpoint | Frontend Usage | Status |
|--------|----------|---|--------|
| GET | `/api/products` | Home page - fetch all | ✅ Working |
| POST | `/api/products` | Create page - add new | ✅ Working |
| PUT | `/api/products/:id` | Edit page - update | ✅ Working |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Home page - remove | ✅ Working |

**No API errors or integration issues!**

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Journey

```
User visits http://localhost:3000
    ↓
Home page loads
    ↓ (Fetches all products via GET /api/products)
Products display in grid

User clicks "+ Create Product"
    ↓
Navigate to create form
    ↓
Fill form (name, price, image)
    ↓
Click "Create Product"
    ↓ (Submits via POST /api/products)
Product created in database
